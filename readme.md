# TikTok Views Generator

## Why?
I made this because I wasn't getting enough views on my TikToks

## How?
I am using what is called a 'headless' browser. Essentially, it acts like a regular browser, such as Firefox, Chrome, or Safari, and simulates a human being browsing the web. The bot connects via proxy servers and refreshes its cookies, so TikTok doesn't know it is one computer watching TikToks.

## Setup
Follow these steps to get set up with the TikTok viewer.
